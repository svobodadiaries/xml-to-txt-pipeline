        <p>
            <lb n="3"/>At 1 P.M. I made an injection
            <lb n="4"/>of olive oil, hot water &amp; soap, and
            <lb n="5"/>it worked out very dark green
            <lb n="6"/>with some costiveness, it allayed
            <lb n="7"/>the pain only for an hour &amp;
            <lb n="8"/>recommenced, I left off sucking
            <lb n="9"/>any sweet lemon or oranges, it
            <lb n="10"/>may perhaps be from it; I only
            <lb n="11"/>took a half cup of very weak 
            <lb n="12"/>broth at 3 P.M. ~ The pain
            <lb n="13"/>however kept killing me until
            <lb n="14"/>the evening, when Alexander
            <lb n="15"/>went to tell Nezamed Din
            <lb n="16"/>of my state &amp; sufferings; He
            <lb n="17"/>prescribed me 4 packets of
            <lb n="18"/>morphine &amp; cocaine to be taken
            <lb n="19"/>every two hours, I applied hot
            <lb n="20"/>formulation &amp; Linseed poultice
            <lb n="21"/>but did not allay the pain 
            <lb n="22"/>[struck through]; the morphine &amp; cocain
            <lb n="23"/>did not also do much good

            <lb n="1"/>died yesterday afternoon
            <lb n="2"/>from a long suffering of 
            <lb n="3"/>dysentery, &amp; hemorrhoids 
            <lb n="4"/>he was over 65 years old 
            <lb n="5"/>he came from Basreh
            <lb n="6"/>lately with this malady
            <lb n="7"/>he had for years, he [crossed out] 
            <lb n="8"/>leaves a large family 
            <lb n="9"/>his wife is the daughter 
            <lb n="10"/>of Eassayi, his eldest 
            <lb n="11"/>son is Dr. Behjet &amp; has
            <lb n="12"/>three other sons employed

        <p>
            <lb n="14"/>The day has not been so hot,
            <lb n="15"/>the N.W. Wind blowing until
            <lb n="16"/>6 P.M. when it fell.~

        <p>
            <lb n="19"/>I do not feel well since 
            <lb n="20"/>two days, this ungrateful 
            <lb n="21"/>behavior of my wife &amp;
            <lb n="22"/>the scandalous way she
            <lb n="23"/>is causing among the
            <lb n="24"/>people is very unbecoming
            <lb n="25"/>for a person like her and
            <lb n="26"/>for our name and reputation
        <pb n="257"/>
            <lb n="1"/>Her infatuity and bad
            <lb n="2"/>temper, and also her arrogance
            <lb n="3"/>in the way she speaks &amp; 
            <lb n="4"/>threatens us, have become 
            <lb n="5"/>so intolerable, it is very
            <lb n="6"/>curious that whenever 
            <lb n="7"/>she sees one of her sons 
            <lb n="8"/>or daughters come up from 
            <lb n="9"/>Basreh, she gets so unmanageable
            <lb n="10"/>and does not care a
            <lb n="11"/>bit for us or for the 
            <lb n="12"/>management of the house 
            <lb n="13"/>as she did two years 
            <lb n="14"/>ago, when Tookyeh had 
            <lb n="15"/>come up &amp; she also cast
            <lb n="16"/>us up &amp; went to live with
            <lb n="17"/>her &amp; went to Basreh 
            <lb n="18"/>with her~ All this and
            <lb n="19"/>other misbehavior have
            <lb n="20"/>cased me much grief
            <lb n="21"/>&amp; pain to see my wife
            <lb n="22"/>treating me in this
            <lb n="23"/>manner ~

            <lb n="6"/>At 6 ¾ AM Alexander &amp;
            <lb n="7"/>I rode in to town and came home,
            <lb n="8"/>my boy Hanna also ~
            <lb n="9"/>I sent for Yacoob Oossy but 
            <lb n="10"/>he was not at home, so I 
            <lb n="11"/>sent Alexander to Père Pièrre
            <lb n="12"/>to see what he has done 
            <lb n="13"/>yesterday; he told him that 
            <lb n="14"/>he spoke to Yacoob Oossy 
            <lb n="15"/>&amp; Risha Khaghak &amp; they 
            <lb n="16"/>are ready to come at 8 ½

            <lb n="18"/>Oosy’s house and found
            <lb n="19"/>him just returning so 
            <lb n="20"/>I took him home &amp; then 
            <lb n="21"/>explain all to him 
            <lb n="22"/>and what my wife wishes 
            <lb n="23"/>to take away, her Kit by

            <lb n="25"/>it belongs to her and
        <pb n="259"/>
            <lb n="1"/>she has bought them

            <lb n="3"/>Reesha Maghak also
            <lb n="4"/>came &amp; I explained to
            <lb n="5"/>him &amp; we sent for my
            <lb n="6"/>wife, she came and knocked 
            <lb n="7"/>at the door in such a 
            <lb n="8"/>furious way, &amp; scolded
            <lb n="9"/>my Indian watchman &amp; a
            <lb n="10"/>bused him for
            <lb n="11"/>not having let her
            <lb n="12"/>come in three days ago, 
            <lb n="13"/>she was so fearfully 
            <lb n="14"/>enraged &amp; in such a 
            <lb n="15"/>language that I never 
            <lb n="16"/>seen her doing so before
            <lb n="17"/>she pitched into Alexander 
            <lb n="18"/>&amp; called him every thing 
            <lb n="19"/>she was in fact wild 
            <lb n="20"/>&amp; insolent, she went into my
            <lb n="21"/>room &amp; began searching for 
            <lb n="22"/>her Kit &amp; close, I called her
            <lb n="23"/>out to sit down &amp; to speak 
            <lb n="24"/>to the two witnesses present
            <lb n="25"/>that is Yacoob Oossy and

            <lb n="1"/>Risha Maghak, I then
            <lb n="2"/>explained to them all that
            <lb n="3"/>since she wishes to take 
            <lb n="4"/>away all what belongs to 
            <lb n="5"/>her she can do so, only
            <lb n="6"/>the Alyiets which I doubt
            <lb n="7"/>if they are hers, she will have 
            <lb n="8"/>to prove and on oath, 
            <lb n="9"/>she consulted, I took 
            <lb n="10"/>them to our sitting room
            <lb n="11"/>first, where there are two
            <lb n="12"/>Blackwood Satin Spring
            <lb n="13"/>couches she had bought 
            <lb n="14"/>for my son to furnish his
            <lb n="15"/>room &amp; given to him as 
            <lb n="16"/>present, she claimed them
            <lb n="17"/>and said she will certainly 
            <lb n="18"/>take them &amp; not give any
            <lb n="19"/>thing to her son; they were
            <lb n="20"/>carried away by Coolies
            <lb n="21"/>&amp; servants of Rufail; she
            <lb n="22"/>then took away a glass 
            <lb n="23"/>candlestick with sheet
            <lb n="24"/>&amp; crystal hanging she 
        <pb n="261"/>
            <lb n="1"/>swore that it is hers &amp; 
            <lb n="2"/>had bought it from Rezooki 
            <lb n="3"/>Toni Lessy; &amp; that was 
            <lb n="4"/>all she had, she tried 
            <lb n="5"/>to take her enlarged photo
            <lb n="6"/>framed &amp; hanged on the 
            <lb n="7"/>wall I declined giving 
            <lb n="8"/>it, it was sent to Paris 
            <lb n="9"/>&amp; enlarged by Alexander,
            <lb n="10"/>but she disputed, so I 
            <lb n="11"/>threw it on the ground 
            <lb n="12"/>&amp; smashed it to pieces, 
            <lb n="13"/>we then went in the
            <lb n="14"/>Oorsy, she found one empty 
            <lb n="15"/>blackood box, she took &amp;
            <lb n="16"/>some worthless objects 
            <lb n="17"/>&amp; her sewing machine
            <lb n="18"/>I locked that room then, 
            <lb n="19"/>&amp; went in the Kefesh Koin
            <lb n="20"/>she took everything away
            <lb n="21"/>as clothes, bottles of 
            <lb n="22"/>Arack, Rose Water, Tbacco 
            <lb n="23"/>for Narghile, small 
            <lb n="24"/>Bahrein mats, washing
            <lb n="25"/>Jugs &amp; Basins and

            <seg type="running_head" rend="top_left">1904<lb/>June</seg>
            <lb n="1"/>other objects, which she
            <lb n="2"/>made me wild to see
            <lb n="3"/>her mean way and 
            <lb n="4"/>greediness in depriving 
            <lb n="5"/>me of everything, I 
            <lb n="6"/>could see plain that she
            <lb n="7"/>wants to injure me as
            <lb n="8"/>much as she can out
            <lb n="9"/>of spite, she wanted to take the bedding and
            <lb n="10"/>pillows but I objected 
            <lb n="11"/>most energetically and 
            <lb n="12"/>resisted in not letting her 
            <lb n="13"/>take them, she saw 
            <lb n="14"/>from me that I was willing 
            <lb n="15"/>to allow her to take away
            <lb n="16"/>things that she wanted &amp;
            <lb n="17"/>she took advantage of
            <lb n="18"/>this; Had I not been
            <lb n="19"/>advised by Père Pièrre &amp;
            <lb n="20"/>other members of my family 
            <lb n="21"/>to allow her to take what 
            <lb n="22"/>she wants I would not
        <pb n="263"/>
            <lb n="1"/>let her do what she liked, 
            <lb n="2"/>but to avoid the scandals 
            <lb n="3"/>before these two persons
            <lb n="4"/>&amp; before the servants and 
            <lb n="5"/>coolies I kept my temper 
            <lb n="6"/>but some times she 
            <lb n="7"/>used to pass the limits &amp; 
            <lb n="8"/>she was in fact, robbing 
            <lb n="9"/>me like a depredation 
            <lb n="10"/>&amp; plunder, by tearing
            <lb n="11"/>away every thing she
            <lb n="12"/>can lay hold off; even
            <lb n="13"/>my old clothes arriving
            <lb n="14"/>her kit she took away 
            <lb n="15"/>in bundles. Even my t
            <lb n="16"/>wo cotton blankets she
            <lb n="17"/>would take them away 
            <lb n="18"/>but I took them, all sorts
            <lb n="19"/>of small articles, cloth,
            <lb n="20"/>boxes, she swept her chest
            <lb n="21"/>&amp; wardrobes, &amp; the Doolabs
            <lb n="22"/>in the wall, so far she 
            <lb n="23"/>went, that at times I used
            <lb n="24"/>to burst out with rage 
            <lb n="25"/>&amp; prevent her from 
        <pb n="264"/>
            <seg type="running_head" rend="top_left">1904<lb/>June</seg>
            <lb n="1"/>such a plunder, I kept 
            <lb n="2"/>quiet all for the sake
            <lb n="3"/>of my health &amp; the scandal
            <lb n="4"/>so that people on hearing
            <lb n="5"/>of what took place not 
            <lb n="6"/>to blame me; and 
            <lb n="7"/>especially that Pere Pièrre
            <lb n="8"/>asked me not to say 
            <lb n="9"/>any thing; &amp; let her take
            <lb n="10"/>what she likes, she even 
            <lb n="11"/>clamed my big wardrobe
            <lb n="12"/>saying that I had bought 
            <lb n="13"/>it from her late son Michail
            <lb n="14"/>&amp; a few days before his
            <lb n="15"/>death &amp; never paid him
            <lb n="16"/>the cost, well this wardrobe
            <lb n="17"/>I had bought it with other
            <lb n="18"/>furniture belonging to
            <lb n="19"/>Colonel Mockler a year
            <lb n="20"/>before Michails death 
            <lb n="21"/>&amp; paid for it; she took 
            <lb n="22"/>away a lot of crockery
            <lb n="23"/>about 15 large flat dishes
            <lb n="24"/>pretending all are hers
        <pb n="265"/>
            <lb n="1"/>but not half belongs to 
            <lb n="2"/>her only about 6 or 8 
            <lb n="3"/>old fashioned round 
            <lb n="4"/>dishes, she took four 
            <lb n="5"/>dozen plates dinner and 
            <lb n="6"/>desert with flowers and 
            <lb n="7"/>gilted round I had bought
            <lb n="8"/>from Asfar Khan
            <lb n="9"/>&amp; she claimed them as hers
            <lb n="10"/>&amp; had the courage to 
            <lb n="11"/>swear that they were 
            <lb n="12"/>hers, she wanted to take 
            <lb n="13"/>my 6 gilt tumblers, but 
            <lb n="14"/>I go so enraged that I
            <lb n="15"/>threw them &amp; smashed 
            <lb n="16"/>them all; she stole
            <lb n="17"/>from my other cupboard
            <lb n="18"/>a long linnen table
            <lb n="19"/>cloth &amp; a dozen napkins
            <lb n="20"/>just 10 minutes before
            <lb n="21"/>&amp; concealed them in her

            <lb n="1"/>look for them I could

            <lb n="3"/>her then she said that 
            <lb n="4"/>they belonged to her,
            <lb n="5"/>I told that I had bought 
            <lb n="6"/>them from Angoorly at
            <lb n="7"/>Basreh &amp; insisted in having
            <lb n="8"/>them she then took them 
            <lb n="9"/>out of the box &amp; gave them 
            <lb n="10"/>up; in fact she was
            <lb n="11"/>trying to rob me as much 
            <lb n="12"/>as she could; the copperware
            <lb n="13"/>pots, basins, two mankals 
            <lb n="14"/>trays, washing basins
            <lb n="15"/>&amp; all copper utensils she

            <lb n="18"/>with her own money 
            <lb n="19"/>I retained by force one 
            <lb n="20"/>copper pot, belonging to
            <lb n="21"/>Alexander which, he
            <lb n="22"/>had brought with him
